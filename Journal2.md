### GUI Programming Assignment 2 - Milestone 2 
#### <span style="font-size:17pt; color:lightgreen"> Journal Entry - Stephen Hewlett</span>

Milestone 2 is a continuation of the work done for Milestone 1, a realisation of the planning, and design, and research into developing our own API.

## <span style="color:lightgreen">Third Team Meeting</span>

During our third team meeting, Olena advanced her ideas for the layout of the new API including the navigation bar and the content of each page.  She demonstrated a model she had been working on and committed to completing the CSS and related code.

Johnny undertook to work on the Home Page.  He suggested that I work on extracting the current weather data from the openweathermap site, while Taylor works on the 5 day forecast.  Taylor asked me to share the code I had already written from my previous work with the website.  I put that code into the group's Slack channel.  Taylor and Johnny also posted code snippets in Slack.

Over the next several days I set up a branch repository, and installed the Electron software that would form the basis to an API.  I attempted various ways to extract the JSON data from the openweathermap site and to represent in my repository with images of the cities and of the current weather data.  I had only limited success in achieving those objectives.

By the following Monday, Johnny had written all of the code necessary to extract the data from googlemapsapi and weathermapapi.  He had some library jquery cod and the javascript functions to manipulate and present the data in the format we had intended for our API.  Olena had added a navigation bar and written most of the CSS required.  It was obvious that there was no point in trying to incorporate the code I had been developing, which had gone in a different direction.

Taylor was still working at writing JS code to produce the 5 day forecasts.  Johnny had more work to do on getting the second map on the Home Page to launch.  Olena had some refinements she wanted to do on the navigation bar.  I set about filling in the back pages, writing the text for the Help screen and the Information and Documentation screen.

## <span style="color:lightgreen">Completion</span>

By Friday we had each completed the components we were working on and done our Git commits, although Johnny was still having issues with the launch of the second map on the Home Page.  He managed to resolve that issue by Monday morning, when he realised that the jquery needed to be called after the launch of the second map.  He then submitted our group repository.
