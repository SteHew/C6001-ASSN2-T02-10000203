This report covers the steps taken by our group to plan the development of an API (Application Programming Interface) that associates weather data with cities located using Google Maps data. &nbsp;Team roles, online resources, wireframe representations, and the 'tools' or software used in developing the API, are all discussed.

The team leader for Group 2 is Johnny Kingi. &nbsp;Taylor Inglis, Olena Skeptor and Stephen Hewlett are the other members of the Group.

At our first team meeting at 10:30am on Monday, 4 September, we decided on the app we would develop. &nbsp;Olena took on the task of producing wireframes to represent the ideas sketched on paper during the meeting. &nbsp;Johnny, Stephen and Taylor committed to writing some 'user stories' to bring to class on Wednesday.

Roles were discussed further on 6 September. &nbsp;Johnny, Stephen and Taylor will work on the JavaScript and HTML coding to create twin APIs - one for the weather data and one for the map data. &nbsp;Olena displayed two wireframes she had drafted (beautiful work!!). &nbsp;The other team members contributed their thoughts and ideas on layout. &nbsp;Olena will complete the wireframes and has volunteered to do the CSS work for the API.  

Taylor and Johnny will continue doing research on API's. &nbsp;All team members have already been doing this but more needs to be done for Milestone 2. &nbsp;Stephen is working on the MarkDown report.



The team agreed on 4 wireframes - a main page (or default page), one for resources, one for Help information, and one for Pop-Up information.

#### <span style="font-size:17pt; color:cyan"> Tools </span>

To assist our Group with this project, we decided on using the following tools:
* Slack for communication
* Google Docs for textual content
* Draw.IO for diagrammatic content
* Visual Studio Code for textual content in MarkDown
* GitHub for creating and managing our repositories

We considered other tools, such as Office365, which offers MS Word and Visio. &nbsp;The team members were uncommitted to one or the other, but most were satisfied with Google Docs for ease of access. &nbsp;We also talked about using BitBucket, or GitHub. &nbsp;Again, most team members did not have a strong preference, and so we went with the team leader's preference. &nbsp;We briefly touched on other communication options before settling on Slack.

Another tool we discussed and may yet utilize is Trello. &nbsp;Olena, who uses this application at her work, demonstrated it to the group. &nbsp;It is clearly a very useful tool for itemizing and tracking project components.
