### GUI Programming Assignment 2 - Milestone 1 
#### <span style="font-size:17pt; color:lightgreen"> Journal Entry - Stephen Hewlett</span>

Once Group 2 had been assigned a Slack channel, John Kingi wrote a message suggesting we meet in the Library on Monday morning to share ideas and plan our work for Assignment 2. &nbsp;All team members agreed.

## <span style="color:lightgreen">First Team Meeting</span>

At the meeting, on 4 September, we discussed the API app we would develop. &nbsp;Each team member outlined what they understand an API is or does, and what research they have done since receiving the assignment. &nbsp;The discussion turned to the idea of integrating live weather data with Google Maps data.

I mentioned that I had completed some video tutorials over the weekend that involved writing an API to access live data from a site called Open Weather Map. &nbsp;I noted that I had signed up to get an API Key for that site.

Roles were discussed. &nbsp;I nominated Johnny to be team leader and the other members quickly agreed. &nbsp;Olena began sketching some wireframes to represent the output from the API. &nbsp;Taylor and I offered to continue researching APIs. &nbsp;Johnny suggested that we all bring 'user stories' to class on Wednesday.  &nbsp;He stated that he would set up a team repository in GitHub.

We discussed tools such as Google Docs and the MS applications on Office 365. &nbsp;I proposed Visio for drawing the wireframes, but Olena preferred Draw.IO. &nbsp;I was fine with that, and suggested she draw up the wireframes she had sketched during the meeting. &nbsp;The meeting lasted about 50 minutes.

## <span style="color:lightgreen">Second Team Meeting</span>

On Wednesday morning, in Room DT303, Johnny, Taylor and I shared the 'user stories' we had each written. &nbsp;Olena displayed two wireframes she had drafted. &nbsp;We all contributed thoughts and ideas on layout. 

I volunteered to make a start on the MarkDown team report for Milestone 1. &nbsp;The others assented to this. &nbsp;Olena logged onto a computer and began editing the wireframes she had made. &nbsp;She, Johnny and Taylor continued discussing the functions of the proposed API and how best to represent them.

## <span style="color:lightgreen">Report Writing</span>

On another computer, I began working on the report. &nbsp;After setting up a 'fork' repository for myself, I wrote a first draft of the report for Milestone 1. &nbsp;I spent over an hour working on the various sections, searching for resources on the internet, and clarifying certain points with team members. 

The others left while I was still typing but I posted questions on Slack to which Johnny and Taylor each replied. &nbsp;I ended that session by doing a 'Git commit' and a 'pull request' for Johnny to merge into the master.  &nbsp;On Slack, I invited the others to add to what I had written.

The following day, I was the first of the team to arrive at class. &nbsp;When Johnny arrived he explained that the report could all be done on the master repository. &nbsp;So, I cloned that to my desktop and continued adding to the report. &nbsp;Overnight, Johnny had inserted captions and links to the wireframes Olena had created. &nbsp;So, I adjusted that part of the report to fit with those insertions. &nbsp;I also added a conclusion.

When I tried to push to 'origin master' it was unsuccessful. &nbsp;Johnny had to send me an 'invite' to 'collaborate', and then my updates to the master were accepted. &nbsp;I returned to work, having completed the report, but inviting Johnny and Taylor (who were present) to add whatever they believed necessary. &nbsp;As Team Leader, Johnny will submit the link in the assignment submission field in Moodle.
